# Names

Most of the characters are named after Japanese
snack brands or sweets. The US release totally
ignores this.

## ペッパー Pepper
I guess this refers to "Dr. Pepper" since the
character is a scientist. I can see why they
changed it for the commercial US release,
but it is funnier than "Dr. Einst".

## カール Curl Karl Carl
This is a cheese puff brand. Translated as "Carl"
in the commercial US release. Cheeto, Chex, or
Clif might work.

## ガトー Gateau
A type of French cake.

## ティラミス Tiramisu
A type of Italian cake.

## フラボノ FURABONO
The closest link I can find is a prominent chewing
gum brand called "FLAVONO".

## ポロン PORON
This may be a reference to the 1970s kid's show
"Little Pollon". But that isn't a food.

## ラスク Rusk
This is like biscotti in the US.

## ミルフィ Mirufi
As far as I can tell, this is just a girl's name.

## ポリンキーはくしゃく Count Polinky
"Count" is an obvious Dracula reference.
"Polinky" is a corn puff snack.

## じいや Jiiya
This is a common nickname implicating "old man" or
"butler," and especially both. Pretty much exactly
like "Jeeves" in English.
